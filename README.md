Wastewater Treatment and Biogas Recovery Project, SDDPL, Baramati, Maharashtra, India

Title of the project activity Wastewater Treatment and Biogas Recovery Project,
SDDPL,Baramati, Maharashtra, India.
Scale of the project activity Small Scale

Project participants Project Proponent: Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Private Ltd.
(SDDPL),Baramati, Maharashtra, India.

At the time of installation, there were no dairy industries in India utilizing mother liquor in UASB
reactor for biogas generation. Letter from president of
Indian Dairy Association dated 08/10/2009 stating methane
recovery from mother liquor treatment is first of its kind in India.  During the manufacture of cheese and casein, a liquid is produced
as a by-product called as whey. During the processing of whey to
lactose, a waste water stream i.e. mother liquor is generated.

Mother liquor is different from waste water from dairy industry or
any industry in similar sector based on following points,
- High COD: range of 350,000 mg/L to 390,000 mg/L
- High organic matter: about 95%
- Low pH: ranges between 3 – 5.5

No other wastewater from dairy or any other sector has such high
COD, organic matter and low pH.

PRIOR HISTORY

Project 2503 : Waste water treatment and biogas recovery project

Activity Scale	SMALL

Registration Date	04 Sep 12 (Date of registration action 15 Nov 12)   

Crediting Period	04 Sep 12 - 03 Sep 22 (Fixed)

The project activity was registered under CDM under ID 2503 on 04 Sep 12 for the 04 Sep 12 - 03
Sep 22, however no CER’s have been issued for the same. The project activity is now seeking CoUs
under the UCR CoU Standard/Program for the period 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2023 and hence there is
no double counting issue of carbon credits for the said vintage period. Additionally, the same has
been stated in the undertaking provided in the Double Counting Avoidance Assurance Document
(DAA) by the PP. Hence project will not cause double accounting of carbon off
